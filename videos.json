It's round like a ball!\n\n00:04.000 --> 00:06.000\nNext, a rectangle! It has four sides.\n\n00:06.000 --> 00:08.000\nThen, a triangle with three sides.\n\n00:08.000 --> 00:10.000\nSee? We can use shapes to make a house!\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:12.000\nThe triangle becomes the roof, and the square the base.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:13.500\nShapes are everywhere! Great job learning!\n```"

Let's learn how to make a simple snowing text animation!\n\n00:04.000 --> 00:07.000\nFirst, we'll create the title of our animation.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:11.000\nNow, let's create our text that will look like it's snowing behind. We'll make it white.\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:16.000\nNext, we'll create many small white dots. These are our snowflakes!\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:21.000\nWe'll place these snowflakes randomly at the top of the screen.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:26.000\nNow, for the magic! We'll make the snowflakes fall down the screen.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:31.000\nEach snowflake moves a little bit differently, making it look more realistic.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:35.000\nNotice how the flakes appear *behind* the white text?\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:39.000\nThe snowflakes moving down create a simple, falling animation.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:42.000\nThe arrow shows the direction the snowflakes are moving: DOWN!\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:47.000\nSo, in short, we created white snowflakes falling behind white text!\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nAnd that's how you make a basic snowing text animation. Thanks for watching!\n```"
